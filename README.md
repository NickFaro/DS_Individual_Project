# Data Science Individual Project

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to determine what baseball statistics help lead MLB teams to more wins in a season.

Topic questions:
- How does a team's left on base (LOB) percentage correlate with the number of wins they achieve in a season?
- Does a team's earned run average (ERA) or its Defensive Efficiency Rating (DER) have a stronger correlation with the number of losses in a season?
- Does a higher team slugging percentage (SLG) or a higher team batting average (BA) have a stronger correlation with the number of wins in a season?

## Selection of Data
The model processing and training are conducted using a Jupyter Notebook.
